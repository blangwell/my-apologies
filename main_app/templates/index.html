  <h1>My Apologies</h1>
  <h2>An experiment in indirect amends</h2>
  <p>Have you ever written a letter to someone you have wronged? Have you ever wanted to send the letter but knew it was better not to? With My Apologies, instead of throwing these letters into a drawer or into the fire, we release them into the world. <a href="{% url 'about' %}">Learn More</a></p>
