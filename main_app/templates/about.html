  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>There are two different types of amends: direct and indirect. Direct amends occur when we fix the window we broke or pay someone back the money that we stole from them. Indirect amends occur when an attempt to make direct amends would cause harm to the intended recipient or another sentient being. </p>
  <p>My Apologies is an experiment in indirect amends. Have you ever written a letter to someone you have wronged? Have you ever wanted to send the letter but knew it was better not to? Why do we write these letters, then? Perhaps we write these letters to reflect on the places we have come, to survey the distance we have travelled, and to sculpt our present selves into something better. </p>
  <p>With My Apologies, instead of throwing these letters into a drawer or into the fire, we release them into the world and make them available for others to see. Someone might be afraid to write their own apology or may not know where to begin. Someone may be hurting and in need of an apology. This is a place for people on both sides of the amends process to progress, heal, and grow.</p>
